				<h3><%= t("home.mission") %></h3>
				<p>
					As leaders of the Northeastern University chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery, our goal is to expose students to a diverse range of computer science topics, and build a community within the university. We believe that there's a lot more to computer science than what you see in the classroom, and we bring people together by hosting events that further their knowledge of the field.
				</p>
				<h3><%= t("home.events") %></h3>
				<p>
					We have meetings every <strong><%= t("global.meeting_composite") %></strong> during the academic year. We usually meet in <strong><%= t("global.meeting_room") %></strong>, which is located at 440 Huntington Avenue. Our past events include tech talks, workshops, coding competitions, and many others. Event dates and locations may change from week to week.
