			<h3>Mission</h3>
			<p>
				As leaders of the Northeastern University chapter of the Association
				of Computing Machinery, our goal is to expose students to a diverse
				range of computer science topics, and build a community within the university.
				We believe that there's a lot more to computer science than what you see in the
				classroom, and we bring people together by hosting events that further their
				knowledge of the field.
			</p>

			<h3>Events</h3>
			<p>
				We have meetings every <strong>Wednesday at 19:30</strong>
				during the academic year. We usually meet in <strong>102 West Village G</strong>,
				which is located at 440 Huntington Avenue. Our past events include tech talks, workshops, coding competitions, and
				many others. Event dates and locations may change from week to week.
			</p>

			<p>
				To find out more about our upcoming events, please check our
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nuacm">facebook page</a>. We use facebook for most of
				our event scheduling purposes, so it is updated very regularly. You can also sign up for
				our <a href="http://eepurl.com/EkKhD">mailing list</a> to receive event updates by email.
			</p>

			<h3>Contact</h3>
			<p>
				For general questions, comments, or event suggestions, the best way to
				reach us is by email at <a href='mail&#116;o&#58;&#37;61&#99;m&#64;cc&#115;&#46;&#110;&#37;&#54;&#53;u&#46;e&#100;u'>&#97;cm&#64;c&#99;s&#46;neu&#46;edu</a>. We are always
				looking for speakers and event partners, so please contact us if you'd like
				to work together!
